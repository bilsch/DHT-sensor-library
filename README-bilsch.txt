I forked the adafruit code so I could make changes but have an easy-ish means to simply pull in remote changes from adafruit guys.

The ruby code is simple-ish but it has been working fairly well for me. 

Right now the code is designed to run from a raspberry pi with the arduino plugged in to its serial port. This will change as I will be implementing an XBee-based sensor grid for the house.
